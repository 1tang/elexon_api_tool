# Elexon API Tool

This is a minimal tool to query data from the [Elexon BMRS API](https://www.elexon.co.uk/guidance-note/bmrs-api-data-push-user-guide/).

> The Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service (BMRS) is the primary channel for
providing operational data relating to the GB Electricity Balancing and
Settlement arrangements. Itâ€™s used extensively by market participants to help
make trading decisions and understanding market dynamics, and acts as a
prompt reporting platform as well as a means of accessing historic data. The
BMRS has a wider user base both within and outside of the energy industry
and includes traders, regulators, industry forecasting teams and academics

Much content derived from [ElexonAPIWrapper](https://github.com/AyrtonB/ElexonAPIWrapper):
* extrapolating DataFrames from the `.xml` response is way less hacky than doing so from the `.csv` response
* grouping signals (`ServiceCode`s) by required arguments makes it much easier to validate queries

## Dependencies

* `requests`
* `xmltodict`
* `pandas`

## Installation

Can be installed through pip:

* locally: `cd` into this directory and do
  ```bash
  pip install ./
  ```
* from GitHub:
  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/GiorgioBalestrieri/elexon_api_tool.git
  ```

## How To Use

* register on the Elexon website to get your API key
* store it in a `api_key.txt` file in this folder
* choose the signal you are interested in (see attached csv file)
* use `query_API`
* to download data from multiple days, use `query_multiple_days`

## Example

```python
>>> from elexon_api import Client # checkout the AsyncClient to speed things up
>>> from elexon_api import get_required_parameters
>>> from elexon_api import extract_df
>>> client = Client.from_key_file() # specify path to file
>>> service_code = 'B1760'
['APIKey', 'SettlementDate', 'Period']

>>> params = {'SettlementDate': pd.datetime(2019,6,15),
              'Period': '*'}

>>> r_dict = client.query(service_code, **params, check_response=False)
>>> df = extract_df(r_dict)
>>> df.head()
```
